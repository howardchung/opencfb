# opencfb

An open source project for exploring American college football data.

# Quickstart

- `npm install`
- `npm run server`: The API is implemented using Node.js. There is a semi-working one in Go.
- The API serves a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) server. You can run queries against it using the graphiql interface at `/`
- Configure the application with a `.env` file in the root of the server directory

# Data Ingestion

- Install Go
- Go to the `golang` directory
- This project uses go modules, added in Go 1.11. If the project exists within the GOPATH, it may not work properly. Changing the GOPATH can resolve this: `export GOPATH=/home/ubuntu`
- Running the ingestion workers yourself:
  - `DB_PATH=<path_to_sqlite> SVC=jhowell go run *.go`: Fetch data from jhowell and save to CSV file, import data from CSV file and insert into DB, mapping teams to ESPN teams
  - `DB_PATH=<path_to_sqlite> SVC=espn go run *.go`: Fetch data from ESPN and insert into DB
- Build a binary for the JS application to use: `go build`

# Database

- The application expects a SQLite database in a `opencfb-data` directory.

# Tech

- React
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Golang
- SQLite
